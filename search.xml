Docker is an open platform for developers and sysadmins to build, ship, and run distributed applications. Consisting of Docker Engine, a portable, lightweight runtime and packaging tool, and Docker Hub, a cloud service for sharing applications and automating workflows, Docker enables apps to be quickly assembled from components and eliminates the friction between development, QA, and production environments. As a result, IT can ship faster and run the same app, unchanged, on laptops, data center VMs, and any cloud. Source: What is Docker Where to start?

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[开始使用 - NexT 使用文档 NexT 开始使用 主题配置 第三方服务 内建标签 进阶设定 常见问题 其他平台 开始使用 Hexo 是高效的静态站点生成框架，她基于 Node.js。 通过 Hexo 你可以轻松地使用 Markdown 编写文章，除了 Markdown 本身的语法之外，还可以使用 Hexo 提供的 标签插件 来快速的插入特定形式的内容。在这篇文章中，假定你已经成功安装了 Hexo，并使用 Hexo 提供的命令创建了一个站点。 你可以访问 Hexo 的文档 了解如何安装 Hexo 在 Hexo 中有两份主要的配置文件，其名称都是 _config.yml。 其中，一份位于站点根目录下，主要包含 Hexo 本身的配置；另一份位于主题目录下，这份配置由主题作者提供，主要用于配置主题相关的选项。 为了描述方便，在以下说明中，将前者称为 站点配置文件， 后者称为 主题配置文件。 安装 NexT Hexo 安装主题的方式非常简单，只需要将主题文件拷贝至站点目录的 themes 目录下， 然后修改下配置文件即可。具体到 NexT 来说，安装步骤如下。 下载主题 如果你熟悉 Git， 建议你使用 克隆最新版本 的方式，之后的更新可以通过 git pull 来快速更新， 而不用再次下载压缩包替换。 克隆最新版本 下载稳定版本 在终端窗口下，定位到 Hexo 站点目录下。使用 Git checkout 代码： $ cd your-hexo-site $ git clone https://github.com/iissnan/hexo-theme-next themes/next 前往 NexT 版本 发布页面。 选择你所需要的版本，下载 Download 区域下的 Source Code (zip) 到本地。例如，下载 v0.4.0 版本： 解压所下载的压缩包至站点的 themes 目录下， 并将 解压后的文件夹名称（hexo-theme-next-0.4.0）更改为 next。 如果你对 Git 感兴趣，可以通过《Pro Git》这本书来学习。你可以访问我制作的一个 在线版本（第一版）。 启用主题 与所有 Hexo 主题启用的模式一样。 当 克隆/下载 完成后，打开 站点配置文件， 找到 theme 字段，并将其值更改为 next。 启用 NexT 主题 theme: next 到此，NexT 主题安装完成。下一步我们将验证主题是否正确启用。在切换主题之后、验证之前， 我们最好使用 hexo clean 来清除 Hexo 的缓存。 验证主题 首先启动 Hexo 本地站点，并开启调试模式（即加上 --debug），整个命令是 hexo s --debug。 在服务启动的过程，注意观察命令行输出是否有任何异常信息，如果你碰到问题，这些信息将帮助他人更好的定位错误。 当命令行输出中提示出： INFO Hexo is running at http://0.0.0.0:4000/. Press Ctrl+C to stop. 此时即可使用浏览器访问 http://localhost:4000，检查站点是否正确运行。 当你看到站点的外观与下图所示类似时即说明你已成功安装 NexT 主题。这是 NexT 默认的 Scheme —— Muse 现在，你已经成功安装并启用了 NexT 主题。下一步我们将要更改一些主题的设定，包括个性化以及集成第三方服务。 主题设定 选择 Scheme Scheme 是 NexT 提供的一种特性，借助于 Scheme，NexT 为你提供多种不同的外观。同时，几乎所有的配置都可以 在 Scheme 之间共用。目前 NexT 支持三种 Scheme，他们是： Muse - 默认 Scheme，这是 NexT 最初的版本，黑白主调，大量留白 Mist - Muse 的紧凑版本，整洁有序的单栏外观 Pisces - 双栏 Scheme，小家碧玉似的清新 Scheme 的切换通过更改 主题配置文件，搜索 scheme 关键字。 你会看到有三行 scheme 的配置，将你需用启用的 scheme 前面注释 # 去除即可。 选择 Pisces Scheme #scheme: Muse #scheme: Mist scheme: Pisces 设置 语言 编辑 站点配置文件， 将 language 设置成你所需要的语言。建议明确设置你所需要的语言，例如选用简体中文，配置如下： language: zh-Hans 目前 NexT 支持的语言如以下表格所示： 语言 代码 设定示例 English en language: en 简体中文 zh-Hans language: zh-Hans Français fr-FR language: fr-FR Português pt language: pt or language: pt-BR 繁體中文 zh-hk 或者 zh-tw language: zh-hk Русский язык ru language: ru Deutsch de language: de 日本語 ja language: ja Indonesian id language: id Korean ko language: ko 设置 菜单 菜单配置包括三个部分，第一是菜单项（名称和链接），第二是菜单项的显示文本，第三是菜单项对应的图标。 NexT 使用的是 Font Awesome 提供的图标， Font Awesome 提供了 600+ 的图标，可以满足绝大的多数的场景，同时无须担心在 Retina 屏幕下 图标模糊的问题。 编辑 主题配置文件，修改以下内容： 设定菜单内容，对应的字段是 menu。 菜单内容的设置格式是：item name: link。其中 item name 是一个名称，这个名称并不直接显示在页面上，她将用于匹配图标以及翻译。 菜单示例配置 menu: home: / archives: /archives #about: /about #categories: /categories tags: /tags #commonweal: /404.html 若你的站点运行在子目录中，请将链接前缀的 / 去掉 NexT 默认的菜单项有（标注 的项表示需要手动创建这个页面）： 键值 设定值 显示文本（简体中文） home home: / 主页 archives archives: /archives 归档页 categories categories: /categories 分类页 tags tags: /tags 标签页 about about: /about 关于页面 commonweal commonweal: /404.html 公益 404 设置菜单项的显示文本。在第一步中设置的菜单的名称并不直接用于界面上的展示。Hexo 在生成的时候将使用 这个名称查找对应的语言翻译，并提取显示文本。这些翻译文本放置在 NexT 主题目录下的 languages/{language}.yml （{language} 为你所使用的语言）。 以简体中文为例，若你需要添加一个菜单项，比如 something。那么就需要修改简体中文对应的翻译文件 languages/zh-Hans.yml，在 menu 字段下添加一项： menu: home: 首页 archives: 归档 categories: 分类 tags: 标签 about: 关于 search: 搜索 commonweal: 公益404 something: 有料 设定菜单项的图标，对应的字段是 menu_icons。 此设定格式是 item name: icon name，其中 item name 与上一步所配置的菜单名字对应，icon name 是 Font Awesome 图标的 名字。而 enable 可用于控制是否显示图标，你可以设置成 false 来去掉图标。 菜单图标配置示例 menu_icons: enable: true # Icon Mapping. home: home about: user categories: th tags: tags archives: archive commonweal: heartbeat 在菜单图标开启的情况下，如果菜单项与菜单未匹配（没有设置或者无效的 Font Awesome 图标名字） 的情况下，NexT 将会使用 作为图标。 请注意键值（如 home）的大小写要严格匹配 设置 侧栏 默认情况下，侧栏仅在文章页面（拥有目录列表）时才显示，并放置于右侧位置。 可以通过修改 主题配置文件 中的 sidebar 字段来控制侧栏的行为。侧栏的设置包括两个部分，其一是侧栏的位置， 其二是侧栏显示的时机。 设置侧栏的位置，修改 sidebar.position 的值，支持的选项有： left - 靠左放置 right - 靠右放置 目前仅 Pisces Scheme 支持 position 配置。影响版本5.0.0及更低版本。 sidebar: position: left 设置侧栏显示的时机，修改 sidebar.display 的值，支持的选项有： post - 默认行为，在文章页面（拥有目录列表）时显示 always - 在所有页面中都显示 hide - 在所有页面中都隐藏（可以手动展开） remove - 完全移除 sidebar: display: post 已知侧栏在 use motion: false 的情况下不会展示。 影响版本5.0.0及更低版本。 设置 头像 编辑 主题配置文件， 修改字段 avatar， 值设置成头像的链接地址。其中，头像的链接地址可以是： 地址 值 完整的互联网 URI http://example.com/avatar.png 站点内的地址 将头像放置主题目录下的 source/uploads/ （新建 uploads 目录若不存在） 配置为：avatar: /uploads/avatar.png 或者 放置在 source/images/ 目录下 配置为：avatar: /images/avatar.png 头像设置示例 avatar: http://example.com/avatar.png 设置 作者昵称 编辑 站点配置文件， 设置 author 为你的昵称。 站点描述 编辑 站点配置文件， 设置 description 字段为你的站点描述。站点描述可以是你喜欢的一句签名:) 集成常用的第三方服务 百度统计 注意： baidu_analytics 不是你的百度 id 或者 百度统计 id 登录 百度统计， 定位到站点的代码获取页面 复制 hm.js? 后面那串统计脚本 id，如： 编辑 主题配置文件， 修改字段 baidu_analytics 字段，值设置成你的百度统计脚本 id。 阅读次数统计（LeanCloud） 由 Doublemine 贡献 请查看 为NexT主题添加文章阅读量统计功能 Algolia 搜索 详细的配置请参考： 第三方服务 - Algolia 文档问题反馈 返回顶部 安装 NexT 下载 NexT 主题 启用 NexT 主题 验证是否正确启用 主题设定 选择「Scheme」 设置「界面语言」 设置「菜单」 设置「侧栏」 设置「头像」 设置「作者昵称」 设置「站点描述」 集成第三方服务 百度统计 阅读次数统计（LeanCloud） Algolia 搜索 回到顶部 &copy; Made by IIssNan 文档问题反馈 文档 @ GitHub (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){ (i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o), m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m) })(window,document,'script','//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga'); ga('create', 'UA-75665289-1', 'auto'); ga('send', 'pageview');]]></content>
