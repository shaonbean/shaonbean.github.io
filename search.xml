Docker is an open platform for developers and sysadmins to build, ship, and run distributed applications. Consisting of Docker Engine, a portable, lightweight runtime and packaging tool, and Docker Hub, a cloud service for sharing applications and automating workflows, Docker enables apps to be quickly assembled from components and eliminates the friction between development, QA, and production environments. As a result, IT can ship faster and run the same app, unchanged, on laptops, data center VMs, and any cloud. Source: What is Docker Where to start?

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[win10+hexo+github搭建个人博客 参考：https://hexo.io/，博客用于记录自己的学习工作历程 参考以下步骤安装 1、搭建环境准备（包括node.js和git环境，gitHub账户的配置）2、安装 配置Hexo,配置将Hexo与github page结合起来3、怎样发布文章 主题 推荐 主题4、Net的简单配置 添加sitemap和feed插件5、添加404 公益页面 安装并配置环境 win10+Node.js+git+github Node.js下载地址：https://nodejs.org/en/download/ Git下载地址：https://git-scm.com/ Github 地址：https://github.com 安装node.js 和 git 步骤省略，按默认傻瓜式安装即可 注册github账号并创建一个以 github昵称.github.io 命名的仓库 根据图中，注册一个github账号，昵称自定义，然后创建一个新项目，名字为：github昵称.github.io 项目创建完成之后，本地生成ssh 私钥和公钥，用于连接github认证，使用上面下载的git，打开git bash 12ssh-keygen -t rsa -C &quot;github注册邮箱（自定义）&quot; -f .ssh/shaonbean# -f 输出以昵称命名的公钥和私钥，方便记忆 公钥生成之后加到github上，方便后面的使用，用户本地和github进行ssh通信 到这里github设置告一段落 安装配置hexo 注：hexo安装前提需安装node.js 和git hexo官网：https://hexo.io/ hexo官方文档：https://hexo.io/docs/ 文中以J盘为例，创建目录github并创建字目录（用于存放项目） 12vdevops@shaon MINGW64 /j/github/shaonbean# 注： 如果是linux环境下搭建的hexo博客，不建议使用root权限 下载安装hexo 123npm install -g hexo-cli# 等待片刻，执行hexo如下图表示安装成功hexo 初始化博客 这里以shaonbean为博客目录，执行下面命令 123hexo init shaonbean # 创始化项目cd shaonbeannpm install 测试本地建站是否成功，输入： 1234hexo sINFO Start processingINFO Hexo is running at http://localhost:4000/. Press Ctrl+C to stop.# 出现上面两行，即表示本地建站成功 初始化博客以后，能看到下图： 配置博客 博客根目录初始化完成之后进项自定义配置，这里用到_config.yml 自定义博客的相关信息 编辑_config.yml配置文件，进行修改，参考下面配置： 1234567title: itdevopssubtitle: DevOps is everythingdescription: From Zero to the DevOpsauthor: shaonbeanlanguage: zh-CNtimezone: Asia/Shanghai# language和timezone 有规范，注意格式 配置个人域名1url: http://vdevops.com 配置部署1234deploy: type: git repo: https://github.com/shaonbean/shaonbean.github.io.git branch: master repo项是之前Github上创建好的仓库的地址 123exec ssh-agent bashssh-add MYKEY# 这里是针对本地设置多个github账号进行操作 本地生成两对密钥对，然后在~/.ssh/目录下新建config文件，参考下面填入： 12345678910111213#————GitHub—————Host github HostName github.com User git PreferredAuthentications publickey IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa# github.ioHost github.io HostName github.com User git PreferredAuthentications publickey IdentityFile ~/.ssh/itdevops 测试本地ssh连接github是否正常 123ssh -T git@githubssh -T git@github.io# 笔者这里第二个账号没设置成功，临时使用的https方式进行的通信 使用https，github账号加密码的方式来进行hexo的部署。配置如下： 123456deploy: type: git #repo: git@github.io:shaonbean/shaonbean.github.io.git repo: https://shaonbean:shaonbeanpassword@github.com/shaonbean/shaonbean.github.io.git branch: master message: devops 配置完成之后，现在可以进到设置的项目目录里面通过hexo部署到github 进到你的项目目录。命令行执行下面命令： 12hexo g # 本地生成数据库文件，目录等hexo d # 部署到远程 新建一篇博客 1hexo new post &quot;devops&quot; 然后通过电脑编辑器（atom）对文章进行编辑，编辑完成之后，再次运行上面的生成，部署命令 123hexo g # 本地生成博客hexo d # 发布到远程hexo d -g #在部署前先生成 注： 安装git扩展 12npm install hexo-deployer-git --save# 没安装插件可能报错：deloyer not found:git ssh key报错 1234Permission denied (publickey).fatal: Could not read from remote repository.Please make sure you have the correct access rightsand the repository exists. 后面笔者会专门写一篇添加ssh 密钥的文章 部署完成可以看到github上面shaonbean.github.io，已经存在文件，通过浏览器访问如下： 从上面可以看出我们已经成功部署到远程，并能够正常访问。 配置博客主题 选择NexT，star最多，原因不多说知乎主题推荐：https://www.zhihu.com/question/24422335 12cd /j/github/shaonbean.github.io # 这里项目名可以自定义git clone https://github.com/iissnan/hexo-theme-next themes/next 更换主题完成后，访问： 参考链接 http://blog.csdn.net/gdutxiaoxu/article/details/53576018 http://www.jeyzhang.com/hexo-github-blog-building.html https://www.zrj96.com/post-471.html https://fuyis.me/2017/01/25/Hexo-theme-next-and-optimized-configuration/]]></content>
